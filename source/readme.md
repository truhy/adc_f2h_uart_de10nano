# ADC to HPS UART for the Terasic DE10-Nano Development Kit

## Overview

A FPGA design (in Verilog) for the DE10-Nano that reads 12-bit samples from the on-board ADC and sends them to UART0 (the mini USB socket for the UART-USB).

In summary, it does the following all within in the FPGA fabric:
1. Repeatedly reads Channel 0 ADC sample data from the ADC LTC2308 chip over SPI serial communication
2. A loop sends a read (when ready) to the existing HPS UART0 (UART-USB) which is wired to the HPS side

Note, there is an ADC demo on the Terasic DE10-Nano CD zip file, but it uses the NIOS II FPGA softcore processor (instead of the hardware ARM) and also a custom Platform Designer ADC IP.  My version is more plain and perhaps more useful for a beginner.

## Running instructions

1. Write the sdcard_de10nano.img to a micro SD card.  Use any of these:
   - Win32 Disk Imager (https://sourceforge.net/projects/win32diskimager/)
   - Rufus (https://rufus.ie/en/)
   - balenaEtcher (https://www.balena.io/etcher/)
2. Connect a USB cable between the UART-USB connector on the DE10-Nano and your computer
3. Start a serial console program such as PuTTY and set it to serial mode, 115200 baud, 8 data bits, 1 stop bit, no parity, no control flow
4. Insert the micro SD card into the DE10-Nano and turn on the 5V power supply
5. Wait for U-Boot to boot up.  You should see a bunch of U-Boot messages and then stop with a console prompt
6. The 12-bit sample reads are displayed in hex format

Note, I've configured U-Boot to boot only to the console prompt.
