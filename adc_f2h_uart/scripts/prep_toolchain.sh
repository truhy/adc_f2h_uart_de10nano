# Notes:
#   Toolchain = C & C++ compiler, linker, tools, etc
#   Host = which OS will be used to compile on. E.g. if you are going to use your Intel PC running 32bits Linux to compile with then the host is x86 Linux
#   Target = which system the elf or binary will be running on. E.g. if the development kit proessor is Arm Cortex A9 then it is AArch32 (32bit)
#   x86 Linux = 32bits Linux on Intel processor
#   x64 Linux = 64bits Linux on Intel processor
#   AArch32 = 32bit Arm processor
#   AArch64 = 64bit Arm processor
#   AArch32 Linux = Linux on 32bit Arm processor
#   AArch64 Linux = Linux on 64bit Arm processor
#   Windows (mingw-w64-i686) = 64bits Windows on Intel processor and mingw-w64-i686 C/C++ compiler
#   Hard float = This refers to the target Arm processor which includes a hardware floating unit (ALU) and this option will make use of it. For Linux target the std C/C++ (e.g. glibc) library needs be precompiled so enabling hard float is not selectable using just a switch.  For baremetal a switch can enable the hard float
#   Baremetal = to build an elf or binary where there is no OS

# Common GCC Arm toolchain binary builds...

# 1. Arm binary builds for Cortex A-profile (baremetal and linux target) (A-profile seems to be discontinued - last version is 10.3-2021.07)
# https://developer.arm.com/tools-and-software/open-source-software/developer-tools/gnu-toolchain/gnu-a/downloads

# 2. Linaro binary builds  (baremetal and linux target) (seems to be discontinued - last version is 7.5-2019.12)
# https://releases.linaro.org/components/toolchain/binaries/

# 3. xPack binary builds (baremetal target only)
